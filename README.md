# Store-Automation-System
This following Software was developed using Java and SQL.And, also this software is a pure example of JDBC.Now, what this Software does?
So, this software is basically is based on whole sale market of India. Suppose, we have a store and we have three users:
1.Admin
2.Manager
3.Customer
.First of all talking about the Admin, well Admin is going to check and update the things coming to stocks and also he is going to look after who all can be the customer i.e; he is going to enter or create the new customer and also what new products are coming in the stock and of which brand. 
Second is the Manager, he is going to work on behalf of admin and look after the Store but he cannot create a new customer or he can input an entry in stock.
The third is a Customer, here they can see their bill, items they have purchased and also if any debt is present. Yes, a special feature is implemented for all those customers who cannot pay the whole price at the purchase time so they can pay afterward when they next visit the store with the debit option.
And one great feature of this System is that if the Admin has 4 stores in different areas, he can check all the transaction done along with the particular dates transaction.
